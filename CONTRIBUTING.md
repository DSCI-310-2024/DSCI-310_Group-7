# Group 7 Contributing Guideline
This guide describes how to propose a change to the project. 

We welcome any input, ideas, and feedback to our project. Whether it would be a bug fix, a new visualization, or a new model. Please be aware that all contributions that are accepted will be under the [Project's licence](https://github.com/DSCI-310-2024/dsci-310_group-7_wine-quality-prediction/tree/main?tab=MIT-1-ov-file).

## Changes
This project will follow the "GitHub Flow" workflow. Detailed contributing guidelines can be found in the [DSCI 310 textbook](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/reproducible-and-trustworthy-workflows-for-data-science/materials/lectures/02-version-control-2.html).

In short: 
* Create an issue so that other contributors may review it and agree if it is needed.
* Set up the repository following the guidelines established in the [README.md](https://github.com/DSCI-310-2024/dsci-310_group-7_wine-quality-prediction/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).
* Create a unique branch through ```git switch -c <your-branch>```.
* Once your contribution has been added, commit and push the changes to your branch through: 
```
git add <modified-file>
git commit -m "Some descriptive message about your change"
git push origin <your-branch>
```
* Please submit a pull request on GitHub so that other contributors may review the changes before merging the branch back to main.

Furthermore, note:
* We use roxygen2, with Markdown syntax, for documentation.
* We use testthat. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
* New code should follow the tidyverse style guide. 

## Fixing typos
Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.
