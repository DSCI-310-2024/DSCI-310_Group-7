    "\n",
    "This project analyzes different properties of wine and analyzes which properties affect the quality of wine positively and which properties affect it negatively. We applied a multiple linear regression on a public-use dataset to discover how each property affects the quality of wine. Splitting the dataset into a 75/25 training/testing split, and applying a specified recipe for a multivariate regression, we obtained decent RMSE and MAE values of 0.67 and 0.52 respectively, but a mediocre R-squared value of 0.32. We discover that the fixed acidity, residual sugar, free sulphur dioxide, sulphates, and the alcohol properties tend to increase the wine quality, while the volatile acidity, citric acid, chlorides, total sulphur dioxide, density, and pH properties tend to reduce the wine quality.

    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "Wine is entrenched in many cultures and remains a strong industry worldwide (Eflman, 2017; *Culture of wine, 2020*). Technological innovations have supported the growth of the wine industry, especially in the realm of certification and quality assessment (Cortez et al., 2009). One prominent innovation is the use of laboratory testing to relate physicochemical properties of wine to human sensory perceptions (Cortez et al., 2009; Luque et al., 2023). Examples of physicochemical indicators include pH and and residual sugar. Using data to model complex wine perceptions is a daunting task, but it can benefit wine production by flagging the most important properties to consider and informing price setting (Cortez et al., 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our key question is: **Can we use multiple linear regression and various physicochemical indicators to predict the quality of red wine?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer whether a full regression model is viable, we use a dataset on red wine quality [from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://doi.org/10.24432/C56S3T). The dataset comprises of 12 variables (11 physicochemical indicators and 1 quality indicator) and contains 1599 instances of red vinho verde, a popular wine from Portugal. Each instance of wine was assessed by at least three sensory assessors and scored on a ten point scale that ranges from \"very bad\" to \"excellent\"; the wine quality for each instance is determined by the median of these scores (Cortez et al., 2009). The data was collected by the CVRVV, an inter-professional organisation dedicated to the promotion of vinho verde, from  May 2004 to February 2007."

    "The multivariate regression analysis conducted on the wine quality dataset aimed to uncover the impacts of various factors such as the alcohol content, the acidity, and the amount of sugar on the overall quality of wine. While the accuracy of our model is a bit mediocre at best, it is still a valuable analysis that can uncover proposals of changing winemaking practices and consumer preferences.\n",

    "Future research should attempt to improve the accuracy of our model, such as incorporating better model selection techniques such as stepwise regression, or to restrict the coefficients through LASSO or Ridge regression. Alternate strategies could be to adapt a non-parametric (i.e. classification) analysis rather than a regression analysis on the data. More data could also be collected to further the amount of predictors and the amount of data there are. For those who are in the winemaking business, this should propose implications on alternate winemaking techniques to better increase the quality of the wine that is being manufactured, and may ask why some qualities negatively affect the quality of the wine and why others positively affect the quality."
